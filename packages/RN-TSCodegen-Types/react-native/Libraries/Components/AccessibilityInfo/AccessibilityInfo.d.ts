   * Add an event handler. Supported events:

   *   is enabled and `false` otherwise.
   * - `grayscaleChanged`: iOS-only event. Fires when the state of the gray scale toggle changes.
   *   The argument to the event handler is a boolean. The boolean is `true` when a gray scale
   *   is enabled and `false` otherwise.
   * - `invertColorsChanged`: iOS-only event. Fires when the state of the invert colors toggle
   *   changes. The argument to the event handler is a boolean. The boolean is `true` when a invert
   *   colors is enabled and `false` otherwise.
   * - `reduceMotionChanged`: Fires when the state of the reduce motion toggle changes.
   *   The argument to the event handler is a boolean. The boolean is `true` when a reduce
   *   motion is enabled (or when "Transition Animation Scale" in "Developer options" is
   *   "Animation off") and `false` otherwise.
   * - `reduceTransparencyChanged`: iOS-only event. Fires when the state of the reduce transparency
   *   toggle changes.  The argument to the event handler is a boolean. The boolean is `true`
   *   when a reduce transparency is enabled and `false` otherwise.
   * - `screenReaderChanged`: Fires when the state of the screen reader changes. The argument
   *   to the event handler is a boolean. The boolean is `true` when a screen
   *   reader is enabled and `false` otherwise.
   * - `announcementFinished`: iOS-only event. Fires when the screen reader has
   *   finished making an announcement. The argument to the event handler is a
   *   dictionary with these keys:
   *     - `announcement`: The string announced by the screen reader.
   *     - `success`: A boolean indicating whether the announcement was
   *       successfully made.
