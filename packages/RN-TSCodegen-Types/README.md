# react-native-tscodegen-types

This package adds necessary types that are missing in `@types/react-native-windows`, which could be useful in writing a TypeScript turbo module:

- `ColorArrayValue`
- `PointValue`
- `EdgeInsetsValue`
- `RootTag`

See [react-native-tscodegen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-tscodegen) for more information.
