## Building this repo

```cmd

yarn build
yarn test
```

## Packages

### tslint-shared

This is the shared tslint configuration for all other packages.

### RN-TSCodegen

This is the TypeScript code generation for TurboModule in react native.

There are two import exported functions:

- **typeScriptToCodeSchema** function:
  - **fileName** argument: Full path to a TypeScript source file, a module name.
  - **moduleName** argument: The module name. It is not reflected in generated files.
  - **targetName** argument (optional): It will be used in **the entry header file**, if this TypeScript source file registers a native module.
  - Output: A `SchemaType` data structure.
- **generateNativeFiles** function
  - **options** argument:
    - **libraryName** property: A string that becomes part of type names in generated files.
    - **schema** property: Result from `typeScriptToCodeSchema`
    - **outputDirectory** property: Full path to a folder to write files. Multiple files will be generated and most of the file names are hard-coded.
    - **moduleSpecName** property: Name of **the entry header file**, no file extension.
  - **config** arguments:
    - **generators** property: An array that is or a subset of `['descriptors', 'events', 'props', 'tests', 'shadow-nodes', 'modules']` to control what files are generated.

### RN-TSCodegen-Test

This package contains all test cases for RN-TSCodegen, with unit test code.

### minimum-flow-parser

This is a Flow parser, just enough to convert necessary files to TypeScript for this repo.

### update-test-files

I started this repo in the days when Facebook is actively updating their react native code generation for Flow. There is no document or specification at this moment.

I need to develop a TypeScript version working exactly as their Flow code generation, and to track and catch up their progress when they are changing their code generation parallelly.

So I started update-test files. Whenever I need to know what is changed in their code, I run this package, and then I can:

- Get the latest `CodegenSchema.js` converted to TypeScript automatically. RN-TSCodegen is written in TypeScript, so the definition of the intermediate format should be recognizable by TypeScript.
- Get latest test cases. Facebook has prepared a set of Flow source files, along with snapshots showing how a `SchemaType` object should be created for each file. All test cases are automatically converted to TypeScript to be my test cases. At the early stage of the development, if RN-TSCodegen produces exactly the same output as theirs, I consider my code generation is correct.
- Get the diff of generated files. In this way I can know how many features are added or removed. This is a very important guidance for the development of this project.

Since minimum-flow-parser is built just for converting test cases, so it is possible that it fails to parse a Flow program because Facebook uses more Flow features in their test cases then the last time. It will be updated then.

## Deploying

- Import `typeScriptToCodeSchema` and `generateNativeFiles` from **RN-TSCodegen** package. This package is not published to any external or internal source yet. You need to make your code accessible to this package manually.
- Call these two functions on your TypeScript files. You can learn the details by reading this [simple test case](./packages/RN-TSCodegen/test/TestE2ECases.ts).

## Notice

At this moment, no effort of integrating RN-TSCodegen to facebook/react-native has been made.
There is also no official TypeScript description files for react-native.
In order to make RN-TSCodegen run, I authored a few of them to get input TypeScript source files compile.
**You need to merge important things from my description files to one that you are using**.
There is several things that need to do before doing this:

- In [this folder](../../tree/master/packages/RN-TSCodegen-Test/src/lib) you will see 3 files. You either use them directly, or merge them into third-party description files.
  - [CodegenTypes.ts](/packages/RN-TSCodegen-Test/src/lib/CodegenTypes.ts)
  - [ImageSource.ts](/packages/RN-TSCodegen-Test/src/lib/ImageSource.ts)
  - [StyleSheetTypes.ts](/packages/RN-TSCodegen-Test/src/lib/StyleSheetTypes.ts)
- `RNTag<T>` and `WithDefaultRNTag` that are used in above files are very important classes that help RN-TSCodegen recognize react native required features that TypeScript does not have. This approach may change in the future.
- `ReactNull | T` is used to represent nullable types. This approach may change in the future.
  - When `--strictNullChecks` is off (by default), TypeScript compiler will ignore `null` and `undefined` in a union type, because they are subtype of all other types. The currently implementation uses `typeChecker` in TypeScript Compiler API to do type inference, necessary information will be lost when `--strictNullChecks` is off.
