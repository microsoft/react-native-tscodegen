## Building this repo

```cmd
yarn
yarn build
yarn test
```

## Packages

### tslint-shared

This is the shared tslint configuration for all other packages.

### RN-TSCodegen

This is the TypeScript code generation for TurboModule in react native.

In [facebook/react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/), you are able to find following files in `packages/react-native-codegen/src`:

- [cli/parser/parser-cli.js](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/packages/react-native-codegen/src/cli/parser/parser-cli.js): It calls `parseFiles` from
- [cli/parser/parser.js](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/packages/react-native-codegen/src/cli/parser/parser.js): It calls `parseFile` from
- [parsers/flow/index.js](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/packages/react-native-codegen/src/parsers/flow/index.js): It parse a Flow source file to `SchemaType`, which is defined in `CodegenSchema.js`
- [RNCodegen.js](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/packages/react-native-codegen/src/generators/RNCodegen.js): It converts `parseFile` result to header files.

RN-TSCodegen provides [typeScriptToCodeSchema](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-tscodegen/blob/master/packages/RN-TSCodegen/src/index.ts) for the TypeScript version of `parseFile`.

### RN-Codegen-Backend

Compile Facebook's code and export `generate` from `RNCodegen.js`

### RN-TSCodegen-Test

This package contains all test cases for RN-TSCodegen.

### minimum-flow-parser

This is a Flow parser, just enough to convert necessary files to TypeScript for this repo.

### update-test-files

I started this repo in the days when Facebook is actively updating their react native code generation for Flow. There is no document or specification at this moment.

I need to develop a TypeScript version working exactly as their Flow code generation, and to track and catch up their progress when they are changing their code generation parallelly.

So I started update-test files. Whenever I need to know what is changed in their code, I run this package, and then I can:

- Get the latest `CodegenSchema.js` converted to TypeScript automatically. RN-TSCodegen is written in TypeScript, so the definition of the intermediate format should be recognizable by TypeScript.
- Get latest test cases. Facebook has prepared a set of Flow source files, along with snapshots showing how a `SchemaType` object should be created for each file. All test cases are automatically converted to TypeScript to be my test cases. At the early stage of the development, if RN-TSCodegen produces exactly the same output as theirs, I consider my code generation is correct.
- Get the diff of generated files. In this way I can know how many features are added or removed. This is a very important guidance for the development of this project.

Since minimum-flow-parser is built just for converting test cases, so it is possible that it fails to parse a Flow program because Facebook uses more Flow features in their test cases then the last time. It will be updated then.

## Deploying

At this moment, no effort of integrating RN-TSCodegen to facebook/react-native has been made.
But I've got facebook's native code generator run successfully in RN-TSCodegen's [test cases](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-tscodegen/blob/master/packages/RN-TSCodegen/test/TestE2ECases.ts).
You can follow these test cases to make it run in your repo. There is several things that need to do before running this code generation:

- Call `typeScriptToCodeSchema` from `RN-TSCodegen` followed by `generate` function from `RN-Codegen-Backend`.
- In [this folder](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-tscodegen/tree/master/packages/RN-TSCodegen-Test/src/lib) you will see 3 files. You either use them directly, or merge them into third-party description files.
  - [CodegenTypes.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-tscodegen/blob/master/packages/RN-TSCodegen-Test/src/lib/CodegenTypes.ts)
  - [ImageSource.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-tscodegen/blob/master/packages/RN-TSCodegen-Test/src/lib/ImageSource.ts)
  - [StyleSheetTypes.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-tscodegen/blob/master/packages/RN-TSCodegen-Test/src/lib/StyleSheetTypes.ts)
- `RNTag<T>` and `WithDefaultRNTag` that are used in above files are very important classes that help RN-TSCodegen recognize react native required features that TypeScript does not have. This approach may change in the future.
- `ReactNull | T` is used to represent nullable types. This approach may change in the future.
  - When `--strictNullChecks` is off (by default), TypeScript compiler will ignore `null` and `undefined` in a union type, because they are subtype of all other types. The currently implementation uses `typeChecker` in TypeScript Compiler API to do type inference, necessary information will be lost when `--strictNullChecks` is off.

Today there is no npm package created for this repo. to use this source code, it is recommended to submodule and build this repo, and then import from the following packages directly:

- `RN-TSCodegen`
- `RN-Codegen-Backend`
